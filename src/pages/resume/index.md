### PERSONAL INFORMATION:

I've written 17 spec feature scripts and five shorts. Three of the features have been optioned and one of them (retitled “Illusions of Cyn”) has been produced and is now available on YouTube (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpYum9M1HFQ)>. Many of the others have won at least one award, e.g., American Zoetrope Finalist and Semi-Finalist, Austin Film Festival Semi-Finalist, CinemaSpoke Winner (twice), and IFP Emerging Narrative (twice).

Recently, I’ve had some flash fiction and poetry published. Also, since being diagnosed two years ago with a kind of cancer “that’s hard to treat and likes to come back,” I’ve been keeping a cancer survivor (so far, anyway!) journal, “The Great Cancer Adventure”.

His best work, however, is yet to come.
