* **Smoke** (Drama) - When an isolated island resort, which caters to the world’s financial, political and cultural elites, closes for the season, a disparate group of attractive young people sit around a campfire and amuse themselves with banter, beer and cannabis, until one of their number becomes convinced that at least some of the others are not who they seem to be.**The Brotherhood** (Apocalyptic) – Banished by the brutal and misogynistic theocracy (The Brotherhood) for having an adulterous wife, Hunter is offered reinstatement to the inner circle of this order, if only he can discover who is responsible for a heretical cult, “She Lives!” Hunter might otherwise be tempted by this offer, but he cannot accept—he’s already dead.

* **Voyage of the Resolute**(Sci-Fi) – Sent on a deep space mission to colonize an Earth-like planet, the crew of the CCS Resolute is cut off, cast adrift and abandoned in deep space. Being too far from Earth to safely risk a return, their only hope is to press on, making some difficult decisions along the way.
