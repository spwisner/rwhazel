Zen calendar thought for the day for Tuesday, March 13, attributed to Rumi: "I learned that every mortal will taste death. But only some will taste life."

*(Following the wise council of some of the members of Writers Under the Arch, or WUTA, the writers group I co-founded here in St. Louis, “to include feelings as well as facts”, this is as good a time as any for me to note that over three decades ago I found a spiritual path which works for me and includes daily prayer and meditation. Before then, I believed in God, went to church (religiously?), and never prayed; now I don’t believe in God, don’t go to church, and pray twice a day. The meditation, just another form of action to my mind, includes brief passages coming from eight different sources, including the Bible, which I’ve read cover to cover over four times to date (when I finish, I simply start over again the next day), as well as a daily Zen calendar, among others.*
