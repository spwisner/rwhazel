Just finished a new, feature-length, spec script, " The Cromleys of Crumbly", the logline for which reads:*Patricia Cromley somehow manages to escape the small, Southern town her family established two hundred earlier as a Freethinker colony and never looks back. When her mother passes away, however, she dutifully returns to fulfill her responsibilities as executor; learn what became of a missing brother; tie up any loose ends from an old love; and leave “Crumbly” again as soon as possible. Forty eight hours ought to do it. Strong female lead.*
