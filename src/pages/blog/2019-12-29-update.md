* Very excited that ORIGINAL CYN has been optioned by Clay Ayers.  Looking forward to working with him and his team. A GREAT, FIRST IMPRESSION, a short, was optioned late last year and is scheduled to be produced early this year.  Looking forward to that.
* Have rejoined Writers Under the Arch (WUTA), a writers group I helped found some years ago, and am getting much benefit from the give and take with that group.
* One of my recent scripts, THE PROTOTYPE, is (so-far!) a Semi-Finalist at the WEScreenplay Contest.\
  Very encouraged.
