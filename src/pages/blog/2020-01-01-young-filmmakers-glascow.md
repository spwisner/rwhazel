Frankly, I think he's giving me more credit than I deserve (although I gladly accepted!), but Jack Edis of[Young Filmmakers Glasgow](https://www.facebook.com/YoungFilmmakersGlasgow)has named me a Co-Producer for their upcoming short, "Edward Talisman's Xenology", which he describes as "the story of a devoted husband who is driven to investigate the mysterious disappearance and subsequent return of his wife; a pragmatic skeptic, he begins his slow burn descent into madness as his very perception of reality is challenged in ways he could not have imagined." They may yet shoot my short, he indicates, and in the meantime I am flattered of course and wish them well on their new project.
