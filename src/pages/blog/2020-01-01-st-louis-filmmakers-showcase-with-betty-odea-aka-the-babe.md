Thanks to all who came in support of our short, "A Great First Impression" (Underground Films, D. Fontaine Director) at last night's Comedy Shorts Program, and thank you, Cinema St. Louis for sponsoring the St. Louis Filmmakers Showcase. Good luck to everyone who has a project in this juried event. (I'm taller, and not just because the slant in the floor at the Tiv is in my favor!)
