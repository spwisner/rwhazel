Just finished a re-write of "The Devil's Due" (*Abruptly fired as the Senior EVP of Wickedness, Malevolence and Sin at Good & Evil, Inc., a privately-owned family firm, the Prince of Darkness journeys to the mortal realm where he becomes a celebrity whose message to unhappy people everywhere is that their failures, shortcomings and character defects are not their fault, but his.*) Actually, the re-write is for "Feathers" the version of this same story, told more from the perspective of the Archangel Michelle, than the Prince of Darkness. In any event, it's still being table ready by the folks at WUTA, so I may make some additional changes over the next couple of week.
