Writers Under the Arch (WUTA), a group I founded some good while ago yet only returned to rather recently, just finished workshopping one of my scripts, "American Hangnail" (*A mockumentary on the fictional National Preventive Disease Foundation. "Thanks to you, we're working!"*).

They liked it a lot, laughed in all the right places, and also made some great suggestions, some of which I'll actually include in an upcoming re-write!
