Nothing new on "Illusions of Cyn" (<https://www.facebook.com/IllusionsofCyn/>) since mid-April. However, several of my scripts have been downloaded from Inktip or requested as a result of my listings there. The most recent of which is for a Korean War story, "Waiting for MacArthur", requested by a Korean production company. We'll see.

Other scripts recently requested/downloaded are "American Hangnail", a mockumentary about charities in the US; "Alternate States", a drama about alternate realities; and "The Devil's Due", a satire on religion.
