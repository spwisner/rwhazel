Just finished a polishing of "Alternate States" (*Bad things happen when four characters in three parallel worlds step through the holes in the boundaries separating them*.) and am planning a table read sometime in January. Lining up possible readers and scheduling dates.

The "Illusions of Cyn" wrap party is this coming Saturday in Houston, but we cannot make it, as I already have something that weekend that would be difficult to re-schedule. Disappointed, of course, but we're in this for the long run. And we will do everything we can to make the premiere, whenever and wherever that is.

The St. Louis International Film Festival is going on just now. Maybe "IofC" will be in it next year! Wouldn't be surprised, as there's reason to expect big things.

More to come.
