D. Fontaine, who optioned and produced the short,**A Great, First Impression**,has submitted it to the St. Louis Filmmakers Showcase. Announcements are expected soon. Fingers crossed.

Also, another short,**An Incident at Customs**, was recently optioned by Jack Edis of Young Filmmakers Glasgow (<https://www.facebook.com/YoungFilmmakersGlasgow>). Looking forward to seeing what they do with it.
