Matthew Carter, who plays the male lead in Illusions of Cyn (<https://www.facebook.com/IllusionsofCyn/>) has a short in the Cannes Film Festival. Wow!

Also, "Alternate States" (Logline:*Bad things happen when four characters in three parallel worlds step through the holes in the boundaries separating them*.) has had a number of "hits" on Inktip, including several instances where readers have been assigned and (presumably anyway) these same readers have downloaded the script. Encouraging of course, and perhaps something more will come of this - and wouldn't this be nice? - but so far this does not stack up to Matthew's very good news!
