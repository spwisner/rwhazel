title: The Great Cancer Adventure continues....
description: >-
  Received my second follow up call from the GI Lab at CTCA since the last
  endoscopy and cryotherapy just ten days ago. They use a scale of 1-4, with the
  lower number being some difficulty, and I reported this time, as well as
  during the first call, that I’m still having a little trouble swallowing,
  though certainly less than before those two procedures, even after making some
  adjustments in my eating habits, i.e., primarily eating foods more easily
  swallowed, such as soups and soupy pasta and rice dishes

Received my second follow up call from the GI Lab at CTCA since the last endoscopy and cryotherapy just ten days ago. They use a scale of 1-4, with the lower number being some difficulty, and I reported this time, as well as during the first call, that I’m still having a little trouble swallowing, though certainly less than before those two procedures, even after making some adjustments in my eating habits, i.e., primarily eating foods more easily swallowed, such as soups and soupy pasta and rice dishes. Also, I had a couple of recent occasions where there was a little spit-up, and have/will report those. On the one hand, this is disconcerting, but on the other, likely, it's just a part of the downhill journey. We'll see.

This past Saturday, our friend, Steve, and his new wife, Juliana, visited us from Boston. We first met Steve when he was an undergrad at Wash U here in STL, and we’ve kept in touch ever since. In fact, he roomed with us in Rio during the 2016 World Cup where we watched matches under the umbrellas of beach-side kiosks and walked our legs off in between the three games, or more, a day. in a dodgy part of town, we shared a cramped hostel room next to a disco which, mercifully, was adjacent to the opposite wall and only played music at approaching 90 decibels on Friday and Saturday nights and not all week. Good meeting Juliana, who is a delight, and always good to see Steve.

in a couple of weeks, The Champ and I fly to New Orleans where we will meet son Peter and daughter-in-law Nicole for a long weekend. Betty’s doing a half marathon that weekend, while we three will be eating gumbo and raw oysters. For the rest of the time there, we’ll be walking the French Quarter, taking in music, seeing the sights, and eating more gumbo and raw oysters.

But before that trip, we have another visit scheduled to CTCA for infusion and another scan; while not anticipating any surprises from the scan, they do show up from time to time, don't they? So we'll see here, too. In any event, the fun never stops!
