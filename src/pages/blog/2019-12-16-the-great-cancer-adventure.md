I discovered quite by accident in September 2017 I have a form of cancer the oncologist described as “hard to treat and likes to come back.” Just now, I’m doing well under the circumstances, but almost certainly this is not something that I will ever get beyond. Having had two years, the next milepost is five years. While trudging this road, I’m keeping a cancer survivor’s (so far anyway!) memoir entitled “The Great Cancer Adventure”, which I’ve posted on Facebook at <https://www.facebook.com/robert.w.hazel.>  I’m going to be posting the entire manuscript to date (some 35,000 words) and any subsequent musings here as well, as this is “officially” my blog.
