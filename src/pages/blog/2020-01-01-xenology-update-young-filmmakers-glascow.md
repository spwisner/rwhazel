Message from Jack Edis of Young Filmmakers Glasgow (<https://www.facebook.com/YoungFilmmakersGlasgow/?fref=ts>) about a project I'm involved with:

"XENOLOGY is cast, crewed-up and ready to go! We're shooting in and around Glasgow this month and some of next, and hopefully with any luck, will even have a teaser trailer soon too. There's a read-through with our actors tonight to go over the script again and make any final notes. On a side note, our locations are great; on Tuesday, we're shooting in Glasgow University's hospital simulation room for a short scene at the beginning of the movie. It's awful weather in Scotland right now and there's no sign of it letting up, but on the bright side that might add to the atmosphere!"
