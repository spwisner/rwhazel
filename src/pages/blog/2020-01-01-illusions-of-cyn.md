The good news about the progress of [Illusions of Cyn](https://www.facebook.com/IllusionsofCyn) just keeps coming! (Teaser for upcoming post, coming soon.)

In the meantime, please take a look at how you can make a tax-deductible donation to the making of this film at <https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/fiscal/profile?id=9483>.

Yes, I am biased, as I wrote the original script and have met the cast and production crew (who are extraordinarily talented and accomplished people), but it's also on themes you just don't see all that often. Don't miss this. Don't miss being a part of this. Content counts, damn it!
