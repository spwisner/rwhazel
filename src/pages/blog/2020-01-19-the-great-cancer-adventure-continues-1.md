Apparently, I will not be having a PT Scan tomorrow after all, as my new insurance company (my employer changed companies this year) wants a different, cheaper test first. Consequently, likely this will mean the appointment with the Oncology Doc on Wednesday will also need to be postponed; I just called them for verification. All of which is to say, while it looked like I would know my future health outlook by Wednesday, thereâ€™s uncertain. instead. And so it goes.
