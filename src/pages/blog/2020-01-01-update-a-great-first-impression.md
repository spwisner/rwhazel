The short made from one of my scripts, "A Great First Impression", was accepted into the St. Louis Filmmakers Showcase and shown this past week, but, unfortunately, it did not make the cut for this fall's St. Louis International Film Festival. Even so, it was a worthy effort, and I got the chance to work with D. Fontaine of Underground Films, who produced and directed. A pleasure, D., and great good luck to you in all that you do.
