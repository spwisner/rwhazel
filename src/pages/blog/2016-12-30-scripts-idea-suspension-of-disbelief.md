Here's an idea for a political thriller:

There's an American, who claims to be a billionaire but is really nowhere near that wealthy; who has squandered the wealth he inherited and gone bankrupt several times; is a horribly profane sexist, racist and bully; has done everything in his power to pay his employees as little as possible and has cheated over and over again those with whom he has done business, all the while convincing the gullible that he is a champion of the working man, especially those of the Caucasian persuasion, while passing himself off as a Titan of Enterprise; and yet who is actually a Deep Cover Soviet Sleeper Agent, awaken decades after the fall of the Iron Curtain, by a Russian oligarch who once was high up in the KGB whose interference in the US Presidential Election puts this charlatan in the White House, thus accomplishing something the World Wide Communist Conspiracy was never able to do, which is to hasten the Decline and Fall of the United States of America, the Hope and Light of the World.

But that movie would never be made, for who would ever find it believable?
